2.5 Access Control Lists (ACL) Configuration
2.5.1 ACL Creation
Purpose: Define rules to restrict access between VLANs based on departmental needs.
2.5.2 ACL Explanation
Access Control: The ACL permits only FTP and HTTP traffic from the Sales VLAN
to the Server VLAN while denying all other traffic, ensuring that the Sales department
cannot access Development and Testing VLANs.
2.6 Summary of Configuration
2.6.1 Documentation
Maintain detailed documentation of all configuration settings for troubleshooting and
future reference.
2.6.2 Testing
After configuration, conduct tests to ensure proper communication between VLANs
and verify that ACLs are functioning as intended.
These figures illustrate the configuration settings for the interfaces on Router 1 and
Router 2, detailing the IP addressing and NAT (Network Address Translation)
configurations essential for establishing communication between the internal
organisation network and the external internet simulation. Each interface configuration
serves a specific role in the network design.
