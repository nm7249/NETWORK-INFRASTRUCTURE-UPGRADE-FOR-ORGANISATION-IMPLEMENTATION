Key Requirements
Network Segmentation: The network must be divided into separate VLANs for Sales,
Development, Testing, and the Server, each with a unique TCP/IP address range to
improve performance and security.
Traffic Management: Use a managed switch to handle VLAN traffic and ensure
broadcast traffic is confined to its respective segment, reducing congestion.
Access Control: Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the router to restrict
inter-departmental communication, with specific permissions for Development and
Testing departments to access each other.
Server Protection: Configure the network so that only FTP and HTTP traffic can
reach the internal server, blocking all other traffic types.
Hardware Reliability: Use a power backup system (such as a UPS) for critical
network components to ensure continuous operation during power outages.
