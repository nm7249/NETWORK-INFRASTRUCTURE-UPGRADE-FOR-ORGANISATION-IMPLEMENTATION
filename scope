1.PROJECT SCOPE
1.0 .Project Scope
This project focuses on upgrading the network infrastructure of a software
development organisation to address performance, security, and scalability issues.
1.1 Current Network Overview and Challenges
The organisation uses a 24-port unmanaged switch with a shared internet connection
configured through Windows. An internal server provides FTP and HTTP services.
Key Issues: Network congestion leading to slow performance, lack of security
between departments, and limited scalability with a single 192.168.1.0/24 subnet.
1.2 Objectives and Approach
Performance: Use VLANs and managed switches to reduce broadcast traffic and
improve speed.
Security: Implement VLAN segmentation and ACLs to control data flow and restrict
unauthorised access.
Scalability: Adopt a modular network design and flexible IP addressing to
accommodate future growth.
1.3 Scope of Implementation
Network Segmentation: Create VLANs for Sales, Development, Testing, and the
server, with tailored access controls.
Hardware Upgrades: Install a managed switch, configure a router for inter-VLAN
routing, and implement power redundancy.
Deliverables: Provide an optimised and secure network, with detailed documentation
and minimal planned downtime for installation.
This condensed version gives a high-level summary of the project scope while
highlighting the key issues, objectives, and implementation plan.
